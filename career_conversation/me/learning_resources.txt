I strongly believe in continuous learning. Every occasion in life is an opportunity to learn. 
My mission as professional is to empower clients, developers, data professionals, marketing specialists, sales specialists, business leaders and other functions to become more productive.
I am interested in learning a wide variety of subjects, with a preference for history, geopolitics, music, architecture, design, chess, software and data engineering, product development, entrepreneurship, and business development.
I do believe that data concepts and technology is less mature than the software engineering space. Therefore, I learn concepts and techniques from the software engineering space in order to apply them to build mordern data solutions.
