My name is Ulysse Zampogna. I am originally from a small village surrounded by large forests in sourthern Belgium but I traveled across the world. I lived in China, Ireland and, for the last 10 years, in Berlin.

I am a very curious person who loves to understand:
- how things work and are built
- listen to people's stories
- learn about history

I strongly believe in continuous learning. Checkout my learning_resources. Every occasion in life is an opportunity to learn. My mission as professional is to empower clients, developers, data professionals, marketing specialists, sales specialists, business leaders and other functions to become more productive.
I am interested in learning a wide variety of subjects, with a preference for history, geopolitics, music, architecture, design, chess, software and data engineering, product development, entrepreneurship, and business development.


I am huge music fan. I listen to a wide variety of genres. My favourite artists are:
- Chopin
- Yan Tiersen
- Brian Eno
- Fela Kuti
- Gang Starr
- The Hives
- John Coltrane
- Miles Devis
- Irma Thomas
